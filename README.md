# bggwebscrap
This is my senior research about "How boardgame features affect thier rating score". 
Files 01 - 06 are run in google colaboratory, 07- 09 are run in Jupyter Notebook.

Starting from file 01, the code show us how to scrape the BGG web from scratch by using BeautifulSoup and Selenium. 
We will get top 2000 game ids, names, urls and ranks from the ranking page, then using this data to scrape individual info from each game page.
Save the file that contained all stats we need as 'bgg_scrape.csv'
